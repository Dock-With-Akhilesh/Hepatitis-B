# Study the behavioural changes of the target HBV DNA Polymerase & HBx Protein with the help of Molecular Docking.

Chronic Hepatitis B infection remains a global health challenge due to the limited effectiveness of current antiviral treatments, which predominantly target viral replication but fail to completely eradicate the virus. There is recent emergence of drug-resistant HBV strains which pose a significant challenge to existing therapies, particularly with the long-term use of nucleoside analogues. In our project, we aim to identify novel inhibitors of HBV DNA Polymerase and HBx Protein with the help of Molecular Docking and different Post-Docking Analysis techniques. It will reveal small-molecule compounds with strong binding affinities, leading to potential therapeutic candidates that could disrupt the viral lifecycle and offer enhanced treatment options. 
HBV DNA Polymerase is directly involved in viral genome replication which makes it a well established and essential target for antiviral therapy. HBx Protein targeting presents an opportunity to suppress viral replication, reduce liver inflammation and cancer progression. Combining inhibitors of both HBV DNA Polymerase and HBx could result in a more effective treatment strategy. 

Aim :
The aim of this project is to identify and develop novel inhibitors targeting HBV DNA Polymerase and HBx Protein through Molecular Docking to block viral replication and progression of Hepatitis B.

Objective  
•	To identify novel small-molecule inhibitors targeting HBV DNA Polymerase using molecular docking techniques to block viral genome replication.  
•	To identify inhibitors of HBx Protein that can potentially disrupt its role in viral persistence and oncogenesis.  
•	To perform molecular docking studies on selected drug candidates to assess their binding affinities and pharmacokinetic properties.
